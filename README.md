# The DeBugdom Project

This repository contains a bunch of scripts I'm developing to be used with Bugdom for Windows.

Please see [my Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PangeaSoftware/comments/fg6vrr/decompiling_bugdom_guide/) for more information.

(I'm transitioning everything in the Reddit post over to [the wiki](https://github.com/nutmeg-5000/bugdom/wiki))
